# 🌐 Personal Website Template (React + TypeScript)

Hello! I wanted to make a simple tutorial and starter kit for building your first website — and actually getting it live on the internet.

When I started coding, I struggled to get templates running. They were too bloated, used frameworks I didn’t understand, or broke before I could even make a change. So I built this free template to help people like me — just starting out — get something working and **deployable** without frustration.

This site is a **React + TypeScript + CSS** template that includes example pages, a linktree clone, and a clean file structure. It’s designed to teach you how to build, customize, and publish your first project.
